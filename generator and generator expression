A generator in Python is a special type of function that allows you to produce a sequence of values over time instead of returning them all at once. Unlike normal functions that use return to send back a single value and terminate, generators use yield to pause execution, save their state, and resume later when the next value is requested. This makes them memory-efficient and ideal for working with large or infinite sequences.

def countuop(max_val):
    num=1
    while num<=max_val:
        yield num
        num+=1
for value in countuop(10):       
    print(value)

A generator expression is a shorter and more compact way to create a generator without using a function or yield. It looks similar to a list comprehension, but uses parentheses () instead of brackets [].

Key Characteristics

Produces items one at a time (lazy evaluation).
Does not store all values in memory like a list comprehension does.
Ideal when you only need to iterate through the values once.
Returns a generator object, not a list.
Faster and more memory-efficient for large data sets.
seq=(val for val in range(10) if val%2==0)
for n in seq:
    print(n)
