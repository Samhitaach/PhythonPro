Interpreters are the computer program that will convert the source code or an high level language into intermediate code (machine level language).
Initially in source code analysis, Python get source and check for some Indentation rule and check for errors. 
If there are any errors Python stops its execution and make to modify to prevent errors. 
This process is called Lexical analysis in python which states that dividing the source code into list of individual tokens.
At last, by using Python Virtual Machine, interpreter loads the machine language and PVM converts in into 0s and 1 s which prints the results.

Source code(High level language)->Interpreters->machine level language->Get next instruction->Source code(High level language)

a = 3
b = 7
c = a + b
print(c)  # Output: 10
When run, the interpreter processes each line:
