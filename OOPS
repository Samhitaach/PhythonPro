Immutable
All fundamental data types were immutable. Once we create an object, we can't modify that object. If we try to do so by chanding the existing variable, then a new object is created.
In Python PVM won't create the object immediately,first it will check whether object with same content is available, to make it reusable. If not then create a new object to that variable.

OOPS
Python is an object-oriented language, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.
INHERITANCE, Polymorphism
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
