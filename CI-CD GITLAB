Setting Up GitLab CI/CD

1. Create a .gitlab-ci.yml File
stages:
 - build
 - test
 - deploy
build_job:
 stage: build
 script:
   - echo "Building the application"
test_job:
 stage: test
 script:
   - echo "Running tests"
deploy_job:
 stage: deploy
 script:
   - echo "Deploying the application"

2. Use Runners

Runners are agents that execute the jobs in your pipeline. GitLab provides shared runners, or you can set up your own. Specify the runner environment using the image keyword:

test_job:
stage: test
image: python:3.9
script:
- python -m unittest

3. Define Variables

You can use CI/CD variables to store sensitive information like API keys or configuration settings:

variables:
DEPLOY_ENV: "production"
Copy
These variables can be accessed in jobs using $VARIABLE_NAME.

4. Trigger Pipelines

Pipelines can be triggered by events such as commits, merges, or schedules. You can also define rules for when jobs should run:

test_job:
script: echo "Running tests"
rules:
- if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"'
