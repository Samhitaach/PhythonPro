The Run Keyword is a built-in keyword in Robot Framework's BuiltIn library, designed to dynamically execute other keywords and
pass arguments to them during test execution. It allows you to invoke any keyword by its name (as a string), with optional arguments,
making it valuable for dynamic flows, parameterization, or test orchestration.​

*** Test Cases ***
Use Run Keyword Example
    Run Keyword    Log    Hello, world!

Run Keyword If    ${status} == 'SUCCESS'    Log    Operation succeeded!
